                  <img id="me" src="/Final-Project/images/Me.jpg" alt="Me">
                  <p>This webpage was created by me, Mike. I'm 32 years old and have been an educator for 9 years. Throughout those years i've spent my time in various places teaching, I've lived and taught in South Korea, have taught special edication for Fresno Unified, and am currently working for Kings Canyon Unified with the district Behavior Intervention Team. I have a son named Sebastian who is 18 months old and he is the coolest. 
                      In my free time I enjoy watching movies, MMA/BJJ, making music, and playing and organizing events for fighting games in Fresno. I also love to collect Custom New Era Fitted hats from "The Clink Room" as well as collecting Casio Digital Watches. </p>

                  <h2>Fresno Gaming Community</h2>
                  <p>I am also one of the heads of the Fresno Gaming Community. The Fresno Gaming Community originally started off being fighting game oriented, but has grown and branched out into many different games and genres. Since 2012 the Fresno Gaming Community has run training sessions, local tournaments, and major esports events such as the fighting game event Cen-Cal Standoff (CCS) which has been running since 2017 and has now achieved Capcom Pro Tour Status. The event has brought players from around the country and world to Bitwise Industries in Fresno and continues to grow each year. We look forward to more news and a post covid return in the near future!
